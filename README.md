A desktop app showcasing the QLearning algorithm finding an optimal solution to get from point A to point B and visualizing data about the learning process going on behind the scenes. 

The GameLogic folder contains the logic for the game (e.g. movement). 
The QLearning folder contains the agent which sets up and executes the QLearning algorithm.
The QLearningGame folder contains all the visual parts of the application and glues everything together.
